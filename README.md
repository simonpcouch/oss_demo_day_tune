lime-green, highly stylized font sits atop five dials, each in their own
bright colors, representing different hyperparameters to

Source code and slides for my March 2023 OSS Demo Day talk on tune’s
error handling.

Many of the demo-ed features in this talk live only in the development
of tune, for now. You can install the development version of that
package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidymodels/tune")
```
