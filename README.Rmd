Source code and slides for my March 2023 OSS Demo Day talk on tune's error handling.

Many of the demo-ed features in this talk live only in the development of tune, for now. You can install the development version of that package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidymodels/tune")
```
